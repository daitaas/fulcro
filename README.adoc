Fulcro is a library for building data-driven full-stack applications for the web, native, and desktop (via electron). It uses React and is written in
Clojure and Clojurescript.

== Fulcro 3.6, and React 18 Notes

React 18 finally made changes that required some (minor) breaking changes to Fulcro. The support for async rendering
in version 18 meant that we could no longer rely on dynamic vars in the internals (React 15 had no other way to
do it).

As a result, some (hopefully never or rarely-used) features are deprecated or slightly modified:

* The dynamic vars `\*app*`, `\*parent*`, `\*shared*`, `\*depth*`, and `\*blindly-render?*` should not be used. An
attempt was made to make most of them continue to work.
* The 0-arity version of comp/current-state is no longer available. Pass `this` to it instead.
* The 0-arity version of comp/shared is no longer available. Pass `this` or `app` to it instead.
* Custom renderers (if you wrote one yourself) MUST now set a React context. See keyframe-renderer for details.
* `\*query-state*` still exists, but is for internal use only, and cannot be trusted within render. Pass app state to calls to
`get-query` if you're using dynamic queries.

Using full React 18 requires that you wrap your app with a version helper:

[source]
-----
(ns example.app
    (:require
      [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.react.version18 :refer [with-react18]]
      [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application :as app]
      ...)

(def app (with-react18 (app/fulcro-app {})))
-----

== Trying it Out

The documentation for this version is in the http://book.fulcrologic.com/[Developer's Guide]. If you're using
Fulcro 2, you can still read the http://book.fulcrologic.com/fulcro2[prior version of the guide].

There is also a https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-template[template project] which you can use as a starting point.

Finally, there is a plenty of great resources collected at the https://fulcro-community.github.io/[Fulcro Community] site.
